This part of the book introduces the basic mathematical concepts needed tounderstand deep learning. We begin with general ideas from applied math thatallow us to deﬁne functions of many variables, ﬁnd the highest and lowest pointson these functions and quantify degrees of belief.Next, we describe the fundamental goals of machine learning. We describe howto accomplish these goals by specifying a model that represents certain beliefs,designing a cost function that measures how well those beliefs correspond withreality and using a training algorithm to minimize that cost function.This elementary framework is the basis for a broad variety of machine learningalgorithms, including approaches to machine learning that are not deep. In thesubsequent parts of the book, we develop deep learning algorithms within this framework.
