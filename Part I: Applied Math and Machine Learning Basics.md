- 简介：
    - 介绍必要的数学概念： This part of the book introduces the **basic mathematical concepts** needed to understand deep learning. We begin with general ideas from applied math that allow us to define functions of many variables, find the highest and lowest points on these functions and quantify degrees of belief. 
    - 介绍机器学习;代价函数;最小化代价函数。Next, we describe the **fundamental goals of machine learning**. We describe **how to accomplish these goals by specifying a model that represents certain beliefs, designing a cost function that measures how well those beliefs correspond with reality and using a training algorithm to minimize that cost function.** 
    - This elementary framework is the basis for** a broad variety of machine learning algorithms, including approaches to machine learning that are not deep**. In the subsequent parts of the book, we develop deep learning algorithms within this framework.
